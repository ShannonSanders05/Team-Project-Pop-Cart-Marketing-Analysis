**Description**:

PopCrt invests a significant amount of money in digital marketing campaigns
to promote their products, but the effectiveness of these campaigns in driving clicks
and sales remains unclear.

Our team was assigned to prepare the report and solve the problem.
As the data analytics team for PopCrt, our task was to analyze marketing
advertisement data. The goal was to assist the company in understanding
which product categories are most popular among different customer segments,
which campaigns are performing best by gender, and which age groups are most
likely to engage with marketing content.
